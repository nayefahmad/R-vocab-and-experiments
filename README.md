# R-vocab-and-experiments

My notes and experiments with R. This is where I play with new packages, and try out and practice new things. 

Here are a few of the things I've been exploring recently (which don't really fit in another repo): 

* [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) - in R!
* [Gower's dissimilarity index for mixed numeric/categorical data](http://rpubs.com/nayefahmad/gowers-similarity-measure-mixed-numeric-categorical-data) 
* Simulating random variables from an estimated univariate density function
* Using bootstrapping to test differences between sample means/medians 
* [The Collatz Conjecture](https://nayef-ahmad.shinyapps.io/collatz-conjecture/)
