## Data

```{r}

df1.readmits <- 
    data.frame(stringsAsFactors=FALSE,
                patient_id = c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L, 6L, 7L, 8L, 9L, 10L, 11L, 12L,
                               13L, 14L, 15L),
       days.before.readmit = c(1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 4L, 6L, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,
                               NA, NA),
                     notes = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,
                               "no observed readmit", "no observed readmit",
                               "no observed readmit", "no observed readmit",
                               "no observed readmit", "no observed readmit",
                               "no observed readmit")
    )




# view: 
df1.readmits %>% 
    kable() %>%

    scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")

```


## Modeling time-to-readmission, conditional on being readmitted

```{r}
df1.readmits %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = days.before.readmit)) + 
    geom_density()
    
    
    
```


## Modeling time-to-readmission, without conditioning
